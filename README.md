# Tic Tac Toe with Minimax Algorithm and Alpha Beta Pruning

This little project is an implementation of the game tic tac toe with the minimax algorithm and alpha beta pruning. I used this project to get some pracice in the implementation of recursive programming and the 
minimax algorithm for searches in turn based games. The folder notebooks contains the ipynb that I used to develop the game and the alogithm. In the source folder, the .py file that can be run is located. 

The game can be played against an AI that will search the search tree to the maximum depth. Hence it is not possible to beat the AI. 

# Summary of the minimax algorithm:
